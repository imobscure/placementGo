# PlacementGo - Problem Set Platform

PlacementGo is a web application built to help aspiring software engineers enhance their Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills. The platform is developed using Django, PostgreSQL, and Django Rest Framework, and it offers a rich set of features to engage users in practicing and improving their problem-solving abilities.

## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization

PlacementGo utilizes a powerful authentication system based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to provide secure user registration and login functionality. Users can create accounts, log in, and access the platform's features securely.

### DSA Problem Set

The heart of PlacementGo is its comprehensive DSA problem set. Users can explore a wide range of coding challenges and exercises, each designed to improve their DSA knowledge. The problem set is neatly categorized and tagged, making it easy for users to find problems that match their skill level and interests.

### Voting and Bookmarking

Users can vote for their favorite problems, allowing the community to identify the most popular challenges. Additionally, users can bookmark problems to save them for later review or practice. This feature helps users keep track of problems they find particularly useful or challenging.

### Sorting Options

PlacementGo provides users with various sorting options to enhance their problem-solving experience. Users can sort problems based on tags, votes, and relevance. This flexibility enables users to focus on specific topics, identify trending challenges, and tailor their practice sessions according to their preferences.
